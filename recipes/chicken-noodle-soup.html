    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Get ready to make all sorts of friends when you bring a big bowl of this
      Asian chicken noodle salad to the next big cookout. The only folks you
      might scare away are the ones who brought regular pasta salads. There's
      just something delightfully addictive about this special combination of
      cold and spicy. This recipe is the perfect catchall for all those summer
      vegetables we're supposed to be eating more of, as well as any dry
      leftover chicken you have around.
